3.7
3.8
3.9
3.10
3.11
3.13 and beyond

I did 3.12, but when I started trying to do 3.13 I misunderstood thinking we were incrementing over the result of 3.12 and wrote all over it. Then I realised what the spec meant by "frontend", that it was referring to the exercises in part 3-b that I didn't do, so I gave up on 3.13 and my code for 3.12 is lost ;_;
